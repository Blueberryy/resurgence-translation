lang["#MISSION_GIVER_MAVERICK_GREET_NEW"] = "Another new one? Wait, you're fairly well equipped.. Listen, name's Maverick. We're in a shit situation here and could use some help, and caps is something I am not in short supply of. Sound good?"
lang["#MISSION_GIVER_MAVERICK_GREET_0"] = "Hey gunny, I have caps, you have a gun. We can make these work."
lang["#MISSION_GIVER_MAVERICK_GREET_100"] = "Doing some good work, these refugees are starting to recognize you, and due to what you're doing, we can ship some more outta here. I got some more work if you're looking for it."
lang["#MISSION_GIVER_MAVERICK_GREET_200"] = "Ah, $playername, good work on tackling this city. Shit is a hellhole, but seeing some people that actually get what I need done is relaxing. Speaking of which.."

lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_ANTENNAREPAIR_NAME"] = "Antenna Repair"
lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_ANTENNAREPAIR_DESC"] = "There's an old radio antenna that's breaking down. I keep losing contact with teams out on missions, so it probably needs replacement parts. Mind getting out too it and having a look?"
lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_ANTENNAREPAIR_HINT"] = "Repair the Radio Antenna in the Salem Ruins. Head straight down the street behind me and make a left after passing the church. A good knowledge of engineering or large supply of replacement parts may be needed."

lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_ANTENNAREPAIR_INTERACT"] = "As you open the circuit breaker attached to the Antenna, you can tell something is not right as smoke is wafting from the corroded internal components. You weigh your options on how to fix this mess."

lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_ANTENNAREPAIR_OPTION1_NAME"] = "Repair the existing Parts."
lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_ANTENNAREPAIR_OPTION1_TEXT"] = "It looks like the power coupling is wearing down and barely working, however, after looking closely, you realize it's an easy fix with a wrench."
lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_ANTENNAREPAIR_OPTION1_COMPLETE"] = "Using nothing but your handy wrench, You easily fix the Antenna."

lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_ANTENNAREPAIR_OPTION1_NAME"] = "Replace the worn out parts."
lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_ANTENNAREPAIR_OPTION2_TEXT"] = "It's hard to tell exactly what the problem is, but you figure if you replace some of the more worn parts, you might be able to get it working again."
lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_ANTENNAREPAIR_OPTION2_COMPLETE"] = "You replace the worn down parts with newer ones and... Success! The Antenna sings to life."

lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_ANTENNAREPAIR_OPTION3_NAME"] = "Replace Everything!"
lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_ANTENNAREPAIR_OPTION3_TEXT"] = "The Tangle of wires and circuitry makes no sense to you. The only thing you can think to do is replace every part with something that looks simmilar."
lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_ANTENNAREPAIR_OPTION3_COMPLETE"] = "After swapping random parts, and trying and failing multiple times, you kick the Antenna in frustration. By some Miracle It starts working."


lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_SETTINGUP"] = "Getting set up, power."
lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_SETTINGUP_DESC"] = "You seem capable, moreso than the others around here. Here's the short and sweet, this entire city has gone to shit. Shadowed are everywhere, the mutants are trying to kidnap people for whatever fucking reason, and the police got turned back on. You came into a rough situation. \n\n\nSo, if you're a hired gun, I have some work. I know there's a power station out and to the left of here somewhere, but I can't spare any manpower. Need you to get there and scout it out, tell me what the condition of the place is, alright gunny?"
lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_SETTINGUP_HINT"] = "Find the Salem Power Station. Maverick said it was out to the left of the camp somewhere."
lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_SETTINGUP_COMPLETE"] = "Wrecked? Looted for all it's worth? Fucking shadowed. Here, payment."

lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_HUNGRYMOUTHS"] = "Hungry Mouths."
lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_HUNGRYMOUTHS_DESC"] = "As you can see, we have a large amount of refugees here, people trying to make it north or coming back from it, who've lost everything, or had nothing to begin with. A unnamed benefactor has paid us to get these people back on their feet and back south, but we can only take so many at a time, with the others having to stay put until our guards return for another group, which leads to this. \n\nI need you to go and get some food and drink for these people, purified water, corn, and some gecko meat. Boil the corn, and cook the meat. You'll get your dues for this, don't worry."
lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_HUNGRYMOUTHS_HINT"] = "Get 5 purified waater, boiled corn, and 5 cooked gecko meat."
lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_HUNGRYMOUTHS_COMPLETE"] = "Perfect. Here's payment, and a gift from one of the refugees."

lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_THIEVINGISSUE"] = "The Thieving Issue"
lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_THIEVINGISSUE_DESC"] = "Well, that power station's a fucking bust, and I know why gunny. You might've seen them around here, but there's a group of not so friendly people who call themselves The Shadowed. Only reason we know that is cause we grabbed one a few weeks ago and tried to get some information outta him, but he barely spit up anything besides the name, and that they sell the stuff they get to some third party, but he didn't name names.. \n\nPoint being, my caps are betting on them being the ones who stripped all the tech outta that place. Go take out a few of them, tired of their shit."
lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_THIEVINGISSUE_HINT"] = "Kill 25 Shadowed Bandits. They can be found around Salem."
lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_THIEVINGISSUE_COMPLETE"] = "Nice, i've seen less and less of them. Good work gunny."

lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_DEADESTDELIVERY"] = "Dead Estuary Delivery"
lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_DEADESTDELIVERY_DESC"] = "Hey, need a few things picked up. This one's from Melvin over in Dead Estuary. Guy's been putting in work over there and he's got us a barrel full of Lure Weed we can use for medical supplies over here. Go and get it, and you'll get a cut of it. \n\nMelvin should be on the little Floatilla we invested a bit too many caps into, but I guess it paid off."
lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_DEADESTDELIVERY_HINT"] = "Retrieve the Lure Weed barrel from Melvin in Dead Estuary at the Makeshift Floatilla."
lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_DEADESTDELIVERY_COMPLETE"] = "Didn't eat any did ya? Course not, here's your cut gunny."
lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_DEADESTDELIVERY_ITEMNAME"] = "Lure Weed Barrel"

lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_NEEDEDREPAIRS"] = "Some Needed Repairs"
lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_NEEDEDREPAIRS_DESC"] = "So, a bit of downtime after the killing, eh? Well, we need to keep some of the machines running around here while we camp, so we need some sensor modules and conductors. Also, we need a fuckton of scrap metal for the walls. Tons of holes in it from the potshots from the shadowed and the odd greenie patrol. Plus, need a bit more protection from the local law enforcement."
lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_NEEDEDREPAIRS_HINT"] = "Collect 100 scrap metal, 8 sensor modules, and 3 conductors from looting metal boxes, toolboxes, and various areas."
lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_NEEDEDREPAIRS_COMPLETE"] = "Lotta junk. Here's some caps, and things that make others require construction."

lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_MUTANTPATROLS"] = "Too Many Mutants"
lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_MUTANTPATROLS_DESC"] = "Fucking greenie took a shot at us when we tried to get near the police department! Taken over the trenches and made trench warfare in this godforsaken place, where the fuck did they even come from?! \n\nGunny, move around the city and cull their numbers, I need to try and find out where they're coming from, fucking hoards of them just showing up outta nowhere! Listen, 20 caps a head, and you'll get some good shit to relax after, alright?"
lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_MUTANTPATROLS_HINT"] = "Kill 15 Super Mutants on the Salem map."
lang["#MISSION_MAVERICK_MUTANTPATROLS_COMPLETE"] = "Here, some chems and caps. I don't judge, just don't do it here. Scares the refugees."
