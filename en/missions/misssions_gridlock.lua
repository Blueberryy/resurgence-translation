Welcome, young one, to our trusted brotherhood.\n\nI am Gridlock, your chieftan. Think of me as a guide, an advisor, and a friend. The 80s are largely autonomous, but my word is respected and is law... at least in theory. Our tribe bleeds, $playername. We are fractured and weakened. The truth of matters is that I need the aid of new blood. To survive the trials to come, the 80s must evolve. It needs... a catalyst.\n\nAre you prepared to become that catalyst, $playername?"

There is nothing more I can teach you and the tribe is stronger than it ever has been thanks to you.

I understand Tweak's initiation trials were not particularly difficult, as many greenhorn men and women wander the salt flats. While under the protection of the NCR, you may have enjoyed the luxuries of Pre-War medicine. That, unfortunately, is not the way of things out here.\n\nWe live off what the wasteland provides, for better or worse. You are doubtless familiar with healing powder; its use, to be blunt, is a staple of our lives. Go; create for me five handfuls. I will not take them from you; this is merely a test of your competence.\n"

I myself have suffered; it is only through the use of power armor that I can still walk.\n\nI have dedicated the remainder of my life to doing my best to ensure that the tribe is prepared for the coming struggle, and as our newest member you are no exception. I know that you are at least capable of battle; now I want you to prove you are a master.\n\nWe will start with something small.

We do not ask and we do not beg; we take what we need when we need it.\n\nA practical lesson is in order. The tribe is in need of food, and you will acquire it. I want you to go to the crazy old crow shooter's farm and I want you to plunder the crops from his field. After that, I want you to pick all the pear fruit and razorgrain you can around the nearby lake so we can distill water. Can you do this for me?\n"

There is one other advantage we have, though... chems.\n\n Most of our chems are exported to the black markets of New Reno and Shady Sands, but we make one in house; motor oil.
