lang["#MISSION_GIVER_ORTENO_NO"] = "Look, I'll be blunt with you; you aren't the kind of person that we want around, so I suggest that you leave and leave now."
lang["#MISSION_GIVER_ORTENO_0"] = "Have we... oh, wait, no, I remember you now. Still interested in helping out or is this just a social call?"
lang["MISSION_GIVER_ORTENO_25"] = "How's your hunts coming along? Still plenty more to do out in the wastes."
lang["MISSION_GIVER_ORTENO_50"] = "Alright, I think I trust you enough to grant you access to our armory. Go talk to Grant if you're interested in trading in for some equipment."
lang["MISSION-GIVER_ORTENO_100"] = "I normally don't offer this sort of thing, but... well, you've earned it. I've told Grant to give you access to the best equipment we've got in our stockpiles. If you're interested, now's the time."

lang["#MISSION_ORTENO_INTRO_DESC"] = "Interested in sticking around to help, are you? I'll take every hand I can get.\n\nIf you aren't familiar with our organization, the Desert Rangers are peacekeepers, lawbringers, and elite hunters. In the wasteland justice must be swift and decisive to be effective, and we aim to deliver just that. We don't recruit from just anyone, either. If you're interested, I've got a simple test for you; I've left a .50 cal bullet in the quarry, and I want you to go and find it. Show me your searching skills and we'll go from there. Oh, no point in keeping it either; casing has been drilled open and it can no longer accept primers. It's an initation test, yeah?"
lang["#MISSION_ORTENO_INTRO_HINT"] = "Find Orteno's Bullet in the Salt Wells quarry. It's somewhere on the surface; remember to look inside the tower and the machines!"

We're in the field more often than not; hunger, thirst, and good bed rest are gonna be much more dangerous to you than running out of ammo. I want you to go out and wander the area and bring me back some samples of local produce. Can you do that for me?"

I'm not gonna throw you into the deep end quite yet, so I want you to start with the 80s that are harrassing the locals. Show them a little wasteland justice."
