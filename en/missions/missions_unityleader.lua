Here we tend to all who have been touched by the Master and the Holy Flame; where the NCR or the grey ghosts call us 'mutant' or 'zombie' or other such barbs, the Unity recognises the truth. We are the chosen, those have been touched by fire and war and emerged stronger and more pure.\n\nI invite you to stay a while and listen, child, for I have much to teach you.\n"

You have been touched by the Holy Flame, and yet you may not remember our Master and the Cathedral. Our teachings will take time to settle, so I shall begin simply.\n\nThe Holy Flame scorched the Earth on the 23rd of October, 2077; a date you may know better as the Great War. It was the death of the old world and its corruption and the beginning of the new; a chance to learn from the mistakes of our forefathers.\n\nAh, but I have begun to ramble. I have a task for you, and then I shall teach you more. Somewhere in the ruins of Salem, there is a bombed out building occupied by the Rejects; those who abhor our faith. There is a holy symbol within that they profane; I would like for you to retrieve it and return it to me. When you have done this, I shall teach you our second tenant."

Humans are foolish creatures, prone to greed, violence, and hatred. Many of the Cathedral's High Priests were all baseless and corrupt; Father Morpheus and Father Flayer were but two examples of the corrupt priesthood. While they were once our leaders, their corruption and blasphemy led to the destruction of the Cathedral and the death of our Master.\n\nI need not further explain to you what you must do. Though we are equal in the Darkness, humanity perverts it for their own ends. Seek the Shadowed all around us and snuff them out, child. Take no prisoners."
