One courier made it here, but he had to ditch the cargo. Said he tossed it down a hill overlooking a Ice Pick checkpoint on the road, and it caught itself on some rubble from a building. Hope it isn't damaged, bring it back. I'll send a guy ahead to tell the Ice Picks to not fire at you for the time being."

Turns out this is some experimental thing from before all the bombs dropped, meant as some sort of alternative fuel for Vertibirds. Seems like it never got there from what I have, but we can repurpose it, and I want more. I've gotten in contact with a old friend of mine and we've been talking, and he stated that some strange fellow came into his shop a few months back and traded some weird tech he hasn't seen before for some food and ammunition, as well as a escort out of there. The Smugglers loved what he had, and gave him a full on ride out of here, but Rodgers got a bit of it for middlemanning the deal. From what he described to me, it matches a housing unit description in the documents you got me, so I want it. Payment has been arranged, and I just need you to go pick it up. Head to the swamps and take the boat to his shack, shipment should be all ready for you. Take a hundred caps with you for the ferryman as well."

When you went up north, somehow they saw you going to and from the swamp, and saw you carrying the tech on the way back. I wouldn't care normally, but they had a interesting conversation when the scout described the tech, citing that they had something similar. Their scout got told to report to the ranger station in Salt Wells, so I want you to get in there and take whatever information they have regarding this thing."

Those republic idiots should keep their heads in the sand they're so proud of down there and stop moving north. Let's make sure they don't follow you back after you raid the outpost and make it seem like the 80s went on a large assault. Knock a few helmets off of heads while you're down there and grab a few dogtags, I can get Widget to spread them around a 80s camp and tip off the NCR that it was them, give them another focus."

I'm looking to get a meeting with one of them, but they want payment before it. I need to talk her, so I need help getting some cash together. Not NCR, or caps, but pre war cash. This is what she wants, and I need you to get a lot of it for me. I also need some drinks for them, only the good stuff. Whiskey, Wine, and some Vodka. I'll see if I can get something nice put together for you as payment."

This group and I had a long meeting with the nice drinks I brought them, but they offered some nice ice cold sunset in exchange for it, so I guess it worked out. They told me that the power cell and the package you picked up from Dead Estuary can hopefully power this entire place down here, so they started telling me what we needed. A lot of it we have, however, we had another collapse recently at one of our supply tunnels and lost a bit of things, so I need you to go and get what we need. Here's the list of what we need from you, and we'll hopefully have the blueprints for the final grid here soon. Good luck."

Well, i'll tell you what they told me. \n\nFrom what they said, they tasked one of their new bloods with bringing the blueprint to us directly, but he wanted to compare some parts of it to an existing power structure? Something like that, guess he wanted to impress the higher ups, but instead he got his entire escort wasted and left the blueprint behind! \n\nCipher ain't happy either, so the kid's getting dealt with, but it's up to us to find it, something about keeping a low profile after his entire group got killed. I don't trust the others to find it, so you're gonna go out, and find this blueprint. The Suits told me it was in some sort of mine and the greenies took em out, that's it. \n\nThis is what it's all been for. Find it, or don't come back."
