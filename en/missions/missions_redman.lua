Regardless, you came to the right place. My name's Redman. Major Redman. I handle most of the job assignments here, whether it'd be getting supplies, killing some mutants, or anything else. I try to prioritize most of these jobs for people who we know have experience and can get it done. You're obviously a bit new around these parts, I'll try to find something simple that may level with your experience. Depending on whether you're able to get these tasks completed or not, I may let you in on a few other job options.\n\n\nAnyways, here's a list of some easy jobs you could get done."

At the very least for all his help, I need to check in with him to make sure he's okay. Some of the traders have seen him enter and leave the quarry a lot, so he may have a living space somewhere in it.

That would explain his absence here. He also said that he would be heading to the mountain range, and that he should be safe without concern. I know Jackson, he can handle himself well, so I don't doubt that he would be safe, but still owe him something for a few jobs he completed here. He never came and picked this package up. It has some funds, and ammunition that he asked for. I need you to take this to him, and not only to give it to him but also to check in on him. Make sure he's fine, and not in any deep trouble.
