Unfortunately, if you're looking for something to do, we're good on all current assignments, and this region is protected from any further harm with those damn ghouls, thanks to you.

We have had several ghouls and other dangers leaking into our passage route, and it's a huge problem. If we can't move supplies and traders through here, we will lose access to the Ashlands and other areas up north. For your first job, I need you to go and wipe out the ghouls throughout the roads. Would be pretty hard to miss them."

They killed some traders that were coming through here not too long ago, chopped them up and devoured them. There's still more out there, they'll get what's coming. Ugh, sorry, don't want to talk about it. Anyways, there's another issue we have. Our meds supply is running low, but we've got a solution, just a matter of whose going to get it. There's an old cabin, or something of the sort, off road not too far from here. Used to be an old medical hideout as well. There may still be some supplies left there. I need you to go fetch them."

We need to get them both out of here."
