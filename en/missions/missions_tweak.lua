lang["#MISSION_TWEAK_OFFERING"] = "An Offering"
lang["#MISSION_TWEAK_OFFERING_DESC"] = "Gotta admit, you got some balls coming out all the way. What do you hope to find out here, exactly? Death? Robbery at gunpoint? Botha those I can do for you. No, you're here to make money, aren't you? Aight, now that I can respect. But if you wanna ride with the meanest, baddest sons of bitches this side of New Reno you're gonna have to show us that you can pull your own weight. For now, I got a simple task for ya. What is that task, you ask?\n\n\nPay the entry fee. $250 NCR and we're in business."
lang["#MISSION_TWEAK_OFFERING_HINT"] = "Pay Tweak $250 NCR Dollars. NCR Dollars can be acquired in many ways, but usually as quest rewards or selling items to vendors."
lang["#MISSION_TWEAK_OFFERING_COMPLETE"] = "Heh... I like what I see, rookie. Alright, I think we can make use of you. I'll tell the boys not to shoot you on sight."

lang["#MISSION_TWEAK_BLAST"] = "Blasting Caps"
lang["#MISSION_TWEAK_BLAST_DESC"] = "Alright, now that we've got that friendly bit of extortion done, it's time to move on to actual work. Though I can't give you the details yet, we've got something big in the works and I think you showed up at a pretty damn good time.\n\n\nYou're a little too green to throw at the NCR, so instead you're gonna help us with long term prep. You familiar with the old limestone quarry near Salt Wells? I need you to go there and head into the caves near the abandoned shack. We've heard rumors of some dynamite down there and we're gonna need a shit ton of it."
lang["#MISSION_TWEAK_BLAST_HINT"] = "Retrieve four sticks of dynamite for Tweak. They can be found in the limestone quarry in the northern caves. Alternatively, they can be bought or traded for by vendors in Salt Wells."
lang["#MISSION_TWEAK_BLAST_COMPLETE"] = "Lemme get a sniff of that.\n\n\nMm... still good. Good find, rookie. Now you're gonna start earning some actual money."

lang["#MISSION_TWEAK_TANKING_DESC"] = "Like I said earlier, that particular trip was long term prep. We've got plenty of time to kill until the boss sends the orders for us to do our thing, so we're instead gonna turn to some matters of maintenance. I need you to go get your hands on a motorcycle gas tank. I think the Crimson Caravan asshats have one in that dumb town. Sneak in and get it for us, will ya? Oh, and if you got caught, you don't know us."
lang["#MISSION_TWEAK_TANKING_HINT"] = "Retrieve the Gas Tank. The gas tank can be found in Salt Wells."

lang["#MISSION_TWEAK_MUFFLER_DESC"] = "Good job last time, that tank was a big help. Problem is, we need more stuff to work with. Gotta find some shit, what was it...right! We need the precious metal from something that was called a 'Catalytic Converter', used on old cars that ran on petrol based fuel, not nuclear power. Go try and track me down a muffler, those are what they were attached to in the old times."
lang["#MISSION_TWEAK_MUFFLER_HINT"] = "Retrieve a truck muffler. There won't be any on the nuclear powered vehicles that litter Saltwells, but maybe some industrial area might have one."

And I ain't talkin just some regual fuck-off battery I mean a big ass battery. The battery from the huge, fuck-off crane in the quarry. Go get it, and don't bitch about how heavy it, is I see how much shit you carry in your pockets!"
lang["#MISSION_TWEAK_ASALTBATERRY_HINT"] = "Retrieve the Crane Battery. The crane is located in the quarry."
lang["#MISSION_TWEAK_ASALTBATTERY_COMPLETE"] = "Holy shit, that's heavier than I thought. Okay, you're permissed to bitch. Good job luggin' this heavy ass juice box back here. Now, with with and everything else, we got some magic...tada! It's a fuckin' gun. Take it, we can make more."

lang["#MISSION_TWEAK_CUTTINGTEETH_DESC"] = "Alright, you aren't totally useless, so I think it's time to actually start sending you into combat. It's still a little too early to jump into action against the NCR, but we've got plenty of shit that we need to shoot. I want you to go out and prove to me that you can fire a gun as well as you dig through trash. Go take care of some ghouls and then we'll go from there."

lang["#MISSION_TWEAK_INTHEGROUND_DESC"] = "Ghouls, Mirelurks, a lot of good work rookie. Good job...but look, I still don't think you got chops for fightin' the NCR. Show me that you can really run and gun. Go to that cursed valley, the one with the nuke, and don't leave until you kill some beady-eyed, eight-legged creepy crawlies."
lang["#MISSION_TWEAK_INTHEGROUND_HINT"] = "Hunt five Radscorpions of any kind. Radscorpions can be found mainly in the valley with the undetonated nuke buried in the sand."

Corporate swine, lobbyists, petty tyrants, and sycophants clinging to the old world like it will bring them deliverance... hmph. Today you're going to be striking at the symbol of their power; the humble trooper. Don't let their unkempt and ragged appearance fool you; NCR troopers are formidable. Their plate carriers can tank low caliber rounds, so you may need to bring something beefier or aim for their unprotected limbs. Go kill a few patrols and we'll go from there."
lang["#MISSION_TWEAK_TROOPERS_HINT"] = "Eliminate four NCR Troopers of any kind. They can commonly be found patrolling the streets of Salt Wells. Attacking NCR Troopers will get you a bounty with the NCR, so be careful!"

I can officially call you a member of the 80s now; once you're blooded in, the only way out is through blood in turn... The Boss, he wants to speak with you. Go see him in the workshop."
