lang["#MISSION_TWEAK_OFFERING_DESC"] = "Gotta admit, you got some balls coming out all the way. What do you hope to find out here, exactly? Death? Robbery at gunpoint? Botha those I can do for you. No, you're here to make money, aren't you? Aight, now that I can respect. But if you wanna ride with the meanest, baddest sons of bitches this side of New Reno you're gonna have to show us that you can pull your own weight. For now, I got a simple task for ya. What is that task, you ask?\n\n\nPay the entry fee. $250 NCR and we're in business. Why NCR, you ask? We're too far south for caps to be worth a shit, so we've got to use the paper. Well?"
lang["#MISSION_TWEAK_OFFERING_HINT"] = "Pay Tweak $250 NCR Dollars. NCR Dollars can be acquired in many ways, but usually as quest rewards or selling items to vendors."
lang["#MISSION_TWEAK_OFFERING_COMPLETE"] = "Heh... I like what I see, rookie. Alright, I think we can make use of you. I'll tell the boys not to shoot you on sight."

lang["#MISSION_TWEAK_BLAST"] = "Blasting Caps"
lang["#MISSION_TWEAK_BLAST_DESC"] = "Alright, now that we've got that friendly bit of extortion done, it's time to move on to actual work. Though I can't give you the details yet, we've got something big in the works and I think you showed up at a pretty damn good time.\n\n\nYou're a little too green to throw at the NCR, so instead you're gonna help us with long term prep. You familiar with the old limestone quarry near Salt Wells? I need you to go there and head into the caves near the abandoned shack. We've heard rumors of some dynamite down there and we're gonna need a shit ton of it."
lang["#MISSION_TWEAK_BLAST_HINT"] = "Retrieve four sticks of dynamite for Tweak. They can be found in the limestone quarry in the northern caves. Alternatively, they can be bought or traded for by vendors in Salt Wells."

We've got plenty of time to kill until the boss sends the orders for us to do our thing, so we're instead gonna turn to some matters of maintenance. We gotta fix up our tanks here, and for that we need tools. Get into Salt Wells and see if you can nick the toolbox the Crimson Caravan uses for their truck. Shouldn't be too hard to find."

We need the precious metal from something that was called a 'Catalytic Converter', used on old cars that ran on gas based fuel, not nuclear power. Go try and track me down a muffler, those are what they were attached to in the old times."

And I ain't talkin just some regual fuck-off battery I mean a big ass battery. The battery from the huge, fuck-off crane in the quarry. Go get it, and don't bitch about how heavy it is. I see how much shit you carry in your pockets!"

It's still a little too early to jump into action against the NCR, but we've got plenty of shit that we need to shoot.

Corporate swine, lobbyists, petty tyrants, and sycophants clinging to the old world like it will bring them deliverance... hmph.\n\nToday you're going to be striking at the symbol of their power; the humble trooper. Don't let their unkempt and ragged appearance fool you; NCR troopers are formidable. Their plate carriers can tank low caliber rounds, so you may need to bring something beefier or aim for their unprotected limbs. If you take down a patrol, you'll have proved your worth enough to officially join the tribe."
