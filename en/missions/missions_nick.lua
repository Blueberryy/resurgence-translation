Well, I manage the transports that go through here, mainly cargo, bodies, and a few other things. The boss assigned me here, so not by choice. There's several issues we have with this transport stop anyways. I'm not just talking about the fog, or the shitty water, it's smugglers and these bandit guys that keep raiding our boats. Speaking of which, we had one probably sink and go out of contact not too long ago. Here's what I need you to do for me. This boat had some important supplies that we were trying to bring to another region. I don't care about the rest of the supplies, we'll work on recovering that, but this boat in particular had a crate, held some special military electronics. Any Bandit would have deemed it worthless, but we need it. The attack took place on a piece of land that wasn't too far from the trader shack. It may take some time to look for, but I don't want to see you again without the box. Deal?"
