I'm assuming you found that message I left, otherwise how else would you know where I am, right? Couple weeks ago, I had two old friends come to my door asking for my help because their group had traveled here. Coming here was not the problem, it was after they had set up the town here. There were a few jackasses who walked into town. Spent a few minutes looking around, and then they demanded payment for setting up on 'their' land, a few days after the group arrived. At first they were planning to refuse, because a couple of random raiders wouldn't be that hard to deal with. Turns out there's a whole group of them. So, they took them up on their offer. Problem is, they didn't have enough money, which is why my friends came to me in the first place, and here we are now. Most of the group is broke, and we can't do trading. I need you to get us enough money, at least to start trading. I'll pay you back."

Since then, we've decided to start doing some exploration around the area, not too far into towns or territories though. I actually need your help with this. We've discovered that there is an old town, 'Waxton', past the valley and to the right. Looks like an old industrialized location, but we don't want to send anyone in there, to prevent any injuries if they were to be ambushed or attacked. If you're willing though, see if you could find anything of use in the town. Try checking the factory, might still be some stuff in there."

Anyways, a discussion for another day. Recently, we had a two man scout group sent out to search an old fishing cabin. Turns out there was multiple ghouls still living inside there, and they were attacked. Thankfully, they're unharmed, but they accidentily dropped and left a large bag which had a lot of useful supplies in it. If you could retrieve it, I'll consider giving you a small portion of those supplies."

The reason why it's completely untouched, well it's flooded by old military-grade protectrons, built with some of the best security, and it doesn't look like they're allowing anyone in. There could be some extremely good materials in there, which could help us rapidly progress out of our current situation. I want you to go in and clear it, but first I want to make you something that will help you get rid of them. Here, take this list and get me some of these materials."

We already checked a controls for it, and it's entirely disabled. No one could activate it, and we think it should be kept that way. Neither should people know about it, because it's still fixable. Anyways, we can easily pull ourselves out of poverty now, all thanks to you. But, there's still a lot of work that needs to get done around here. Speaking of which, one of our engineers said that the missile should contain a military-grade circuit board, which he really wants for 'experimentation' purposes, and possibly make some use out of it for us. Issue is, we can't get it because it's too irradiated down there. We'd melt in seconds, and we don't have any Radsuits. I'm asking if you can go down, and retrieve it. How you're gonna get down there without dying to radiation? That's for you to figure out."

Double the amount of what you gave to us in the first place. But, I actually need you to do something first before I give this to you.
