I don't believe i've seen or heard of you, my name is Sky Two Bears, I am what you would call, someone who lives with the land. I am trying to make sure that people like you do not fall like those I have seen before, establish yourself with Jackson, then return to me."

Some time ago, I trusted a group of people struggling to survive, only for them to turn on me, and steal things I was willing to give to them had they just spoken to me! But, from what I hear, they have since either died, or moved on. However, I wish to see if they left some of what they stole from me behind. Find their old settlement, and see if anything remains, and bring it to me. I imagine they would have boxed it for safeguarding."

I would like you to get your hands on some of their hides, I would say 3 of them would do, I would like to test their strength and see if they are able to be used for some uses I have in mind for them. There are some in this region that stay around their den, I hear it is near the riverbed. May the wind look favorably upon you."

I do not know why they want them, but if they are happy, they will be trading some interesting things for them, but worry not, I am not the only one that will be sharing in it! In the meantime, take these, I had a radscorpion guide me to them in a vision after ingesting too much Xander Root, but I do not like the fizziness!"
