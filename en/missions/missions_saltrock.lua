We need some raw explosives to reopen a collapsed tunnel and other needs we have, but we got some of that fancy energy shit instead. Get us some dynamite, as well as one of those makeshift tin grenades and a proper frag grenade as well. Can get you some of that fancy energy stuff and some cash for it, and we can talk more."
lang["#MISSION_SALTROCK_BLOWTHEPATH_HINT"] = "Obtain dynamite, a frag grenade, and a tin grenade. You can find Dynamite in the quarry under Salt Wells Quarry. You can craft, or have someone craft you a tin grenade. You can find frag grenades in explosive boxes, or rarely in mailboxes."

I want you to get used to your surroundings, but moreso, what inhabits it. Bunch of Ants prowling around this area, go make holes in a bunch of them for me, will ya? Oh, and try to collect the eggs and some nectar if you can."
lang["#MISSION_SALTROCK_CRITTERS_HINT"] = "Eliminate 10 Ants in Yolla Bolly. They can be found in Riverbeds, and in the caves near the Rock Biter Territory. He also mentioned for you to grab the eggs and nectar for some reason?"

They need some stuff to keep them going, A bunch of them prefer eggs to eat, some special stew they make or something, but Elliot in particular uses that Nectar they have to pull long shifts. Gimme some of the eggs and a nice condensed bottle of Nectar for them, just like I thought, and I can get them to open their coffers for you."

Those stopping us around here aren't the NCR, but those valley survivalist fucks. They're more focused with taking this entire place for themselves, even though we got to Yolla first! They've shown time and time again they can't keep their fucking word, now they have the NCR influencing them more and more. Take out a few of them, 2 or 3 patrols should be enough."

There's some friends of mine that need some gold, but our reserves are low. Keeping these people happy is in our best interest, so I need your help. You get me 3 golden bars and I can give you a nice stack of caps, not dollars, caps. I'll even throw in a some of those energy things that we don't use, alright? This might take you a bit, so i'll keep them at bay while you look. Do this, and i'll put in a good word for you with them, alright?"

I've been trying to track down equipment that might give us an idea of what we're blowing into, but it's been dead ends for years, until recently. I got some old transportation logs of some remote sensors from one of those folks up in Salem, and might've struck gold. Turns out, there was a shipment of them being transported down to the Quarry in Salt Wells, but they never made it there. I can't send any of my normal guys as the NCR will see them and mow them down, but you seem like you can handle yourself. Find the crate and bring it back."

One of the main things in here is missing a central component that wasn't included in that shipment is some kind of central sensor or something, I doubt we're gonna find one due to uh, everything that happened, but we can make it work. I talked to Gadget, and he said we can rip it out of a existing device, so I got a plan. There was another excavation site somewhere here in the mountain range, need you to find it and see if you can salvage some equipment from it, specifically any old sensor equipment they might have so I can have Gadget rip it apart. Only thing I know about it's location is that it had some winding path leading up to it, but that's it. Good luck kid."

We're setting up a system with all the Toolmasters with Gadget at the head, and they've put together a list of things they need right now to get all the equipment in working order. I got my share of the list, which means, it's your share of the list. I'm a bit too up there in age to be out scavenging, also, with what those fucking frontiersmen did to me when they found me makes me not wanna go back out there again. Get the stuff, then we'll see the fruits of our labour."

They were able to get all the sensors up and things like that, but they need some kind of special computer for it, some kind of specific Operating System or something? The Toolmasters are the one that know all this stuff, but they need a special computer. There's a old Apricot electronics repair facility north of here, in a place called The Ashlands by the locals nowadays. Should be a three story building or so, but get into there and grab the Terminal, and get the fuck out of there. Only things I hear about that hellscape is that it's a constant warzone, so keep your head down, find the factory, get the computer and get back here with just as many holes as you left with, alright kid?"
