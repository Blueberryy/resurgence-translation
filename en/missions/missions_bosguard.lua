I'm willing to potentially let you in, waster, but first you have to make yourself useful to us. As you may or may not be aware, the Brotherhood of Steel collects and maintains valuable pre-war technology. We are missing the blueprints for one such piece of technology and we believe we have found its location. If you retrieve it for us, I will see about getting you access.\n\nIf you have no intention of helping us, do not bother returning."

When we first arrived here, we did not expect major resistance from the local Ice Pick raider gang. I must admit that we have dramatically underestimated them, and despite being here for only a few weeks we have already sent a dozen good men and women to Lost Hills in body bags. This cannot stand. A bounty has been authorized for these fiends; kill 10 of them and you will be duly compensated."

I do not like it, and I know for a fact savages like this are not capable of handloading such complex ammunition.

It is a trifle, really, but trusted couriers are in short supply.\n\nWe have ordered certain specialist materials from the Crimson Caravan that are waiting at Camp Willow for pickup. I will not trust a fresh-faced initiate with this task, for they are too vital to be lost or sold. The burden of this task falls to you; are you willing?"
