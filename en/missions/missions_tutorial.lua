Most chances are that it won't take that long. Otherwise, if you are just looking for work, I suggest going to the uphill town that's not far from here, just follow the road and take a left into the ravine. You shouldn't miss it.\n\n\n\n[ This is a series of tasks for players to start out with. This is not required to be completed, but it is recommended to those who are newer to the game and can offer a starting bonus. ]"
lang["#MISSION_GIVER_STARTER_GREET"] = "Hello, Wastelander. I can teach you the ropes of surviving out here if you'd like. Otherwise, I'd recommend going to the NCR town if you're looking for a job or some trading to do.\n\n\n\n\n(This tutorial is a series of missions that explain the basics of gameplay. It is not required to be completed by any means, but can offer the player extra starting items. Completing these missions is recommended if you are inexperienced with the gamemode.)"

lang["#MISSION_STARTER_NEWAROUNDHERE"] = "Tutorial: New Around Here"
lang["#MISSION_STARTER_NEWAROUNDHERE_DESC"] = "So, let's start with something basic for you. Obviously, the wasteland is a very dangerous place, inhabited by mutated animals, raiders, and abominations. To say everything here is hostile is an overstatement, but there are a good chunk of people, enemies, who will likely rob you, or just shoot to kill. This is where you'll need me the most. I teach other newcomers, like yourself, how to protect themselves out here. Anyways, your first task is going to be very simple. Scavenging, not that hard, is it? Show me you at least know how to gather items. You may find some things that may seem worthless and non-beneficial, but that does not make it entirely useless. There is a town just downhill from here, it's a good place to start."
lang["#MISSION_STARTER_NEWAROUNDHERE_HINT"] = "Find some containers to loot in your general vicinity. You can try going to the town downhill, and searching a few of the buildings. When you have finished looting the containers, return to Andrew to turn in the assignment."
lang["#MISSION_STARTER_NEWAROUNDHERE_COMPLETE"] = "Great, you know the principle of the wasteland."

lang["#MISSION_STARTER_WASTELANDREPO"] = "Tutorial: Wasteland Repo"
lang["#MISSION_STARTER_WASTELANDREPO_DESC"] = "You'll be doing a lot of scavenging in the future. And for the money, you can use that at the NCR town that's not too far from here. For now, I have more things to teach you. Sometimes, while you're wandering the roads, you'll find old, crappy, likely burnt-out vehicles, too broken to be repaired. These vehicular bodies may never drive again, but they can be recycled, or salvaged for their scraps. What people usually do with the scraps? That's entirely up to them. I want you to show me that you know how to disassemble them. Try hitting them with your hands, or a tool of some sort. Don't just disassemble a small portion of the vehicle either, I want to see you take apart the entire thing."
lang["#MISSION_STARTER_WASTELANDREPO_HINT"] = "Fully salvage some of the broken down vehicles or trashpiles near the old town. They can be salvaged by attacking them with your fists, or a blunt melee weapon. Different melee weapons let you salvage them faster. Remember that you need to salvage the vehicle several times to fully break it down. Once completed, return to Andrew to turn in the assignment."
lang["#MISSION_STARTER_WASTELANDREPO_COMPLETE"] = "Great job. That scrap can always be put to better use."

lang["#MISSION_STARTER_GIFTSFROMGAIA"] = "Tutorial: Gifts From Gaia"
lang["#MISSION_STARTER_GIFTSFROMGAIA_DESC"] = "Now for something that might take a more gentle touch. Around the wasteland, many wild plants grow freely. Plants such as Broc flower, Jalapeño pepper, Barrel cactus fruit, Banana yucca fruit, and Xander root can be found. These plants can be used in hand-crafting wasteland style healing remedies and many cooking recipes. I want to see that you're able to pick these plants without destroying them. And, once you're finished with that, I'll tell you how to make some healing powder."
lang["#MISSION_STARTER_GIFTSFROMGAIA_HINT"] = "Harvest a couple of the plants in your area. Plants will generally grow near some of the rocks, bushes, and trees. When you have finished harvesting plants, return to Andrew to turn in the assignment."

lang["#MISSION_STARTER_POWDERINTHEWOUND"] = "Tutorial: Strange Powder"
lang["#MISSION_STARTER_POWDERINTHEWOUND_DESC"] = "So, I'll tell you how to make healing powder. Quite a useful thing to know. There's a campfire right around the corner here. You can light it and crush the xander root while mixing it with the flower in the pot. It will smell awful, but you'll get use to it. Got a question for you, have you ever had an encounter with an enemy or mutant yet? Chances are you likely have, maybe once or twice. This powder is useful for healing wounds after fights, that's if you made it out alive."
lang["#MISSION_STARTER_POWDERINTHEWOUND_HINT"] = "Create a healing powder at a campfire. There is a campfire right next to the guard outpost at the checkpoint. Once finished, return to Andrew to turn in the assignment."

lang["#MISSION_STARTER_TOTALBREAKDOWN"] = "Tutorial: Total Breakdown"
lang["#MISSION_STARTER_TOTALBREAKDOWN_DESC"] = "Alright, seeing as you now know how to make some basic healing medicine, I think it's time you also learn how to disassemble junk, so you can use it for greater purposes. No, I don't mean by breaking down more cars, but instead those items that you may find from them, like tin cans and clipboards. Sounds simple enough, right? There should be a workbench in one of the tents behind you, which should have the tools that will allow you to disassemble most things."
lang["#MISSION_STARTER_TOTALBREAKDOWN_HINT"] = "Breakdown any item at a workbench. There is a workbench in the commander tent right next to the checkpoint. Once finished, return to Andrew to turn in the assignment."

lang["#MISSION_STARTER_FOODPREPARER"] = "Tutorial: Food Preparer"
lang["#MISSION_STARTER_FOODPREPARER_DESC"] = "Another important thing you'll have to learn to do out here is cooking your own food. Obviously, you could go for a while without food, but eventually at some point you may want to eat something. Food helps keep your endurance and satiation up. I'll show you how to cook a mantis foreleg, probably not the best in terms of taste, but it's a good place to start. First, you're gonna have to get the leg. You could get it from, well obviously hunting a mantis and taking its leg, or you could talk to one of the hunter traders at the NCR town, they might have one. Don't worry about the rest of the stuff, I'll get that for you."
lang["#MISSION_STARTER_FOODPREPARER_HINT"] = "Fetch a Mantis Foreleg for Andrew. You can get one from hunting and killing a Mantis, or you can go to the NCR town and talk to a trader to buy it from them. Once obtained, return to Andrew to turn in the assignment."
lang["#MISSION_STARTER_FOODPREPARER_COMPLETE"] = "Okay, you have a leg. Take these other ingredients as well."

lang["#MISSION_STARTER_JUSTADDFIRE"] = "Tutorial: Just Add Fire"
lang["#MISSION_STARTER_JUSTADDFIRE_DESC"] = "Now that you have all the materials, similar to what I told you to do with the healing powder, excluding crushing it, go and cook it. I'd be safe to assume you know how to cook stuff, right?"

lang["#MISSION_STARTER_GHOULDUEL"] = "Tutorial: Ghoul Duel"
lang["#MISSION_STARTER_GHOULDUEL_DESC"] = "You seem ready. So, consider this a final test. We've had a few ghouls roaming around not too far from here, and to prove yourself, I want you to go and take them out. You should have a weapon, if you have not realized already because of your lack of perception, but I want you to go and gut a few of them for me."
lang["#MISSION_STARTER_GHOULDUEL_HINT"] = "Find and kill Feral Ghouls. They can be found throughout the old town or in the warehouse at the junkyard. Be careful in any situation that you run into a Feral Ghoul Reaver, as they are significantly more dangerous. Once finished, return to Andrew to turn in the assignment."
lang["#MISSION_STARTER_GHOULDUEL_COMPLETE"] = "Great job, you definitely know how to fight."

lang["#MISSION_STARTER_MAJORREDMAN"] = "Tutorial: Wrapping Up"
lang["#MISSION_STARTER_MAJORREDMAN_DESC"] = "Well, seems to me like you know enough of the basics. You're probably eager to do more, so my suggestion is to talk to Major Redman. He'll get you set up on some simple jobs. Let him know that I sent you."
lang["#MISSION_STARTER_MAJORREDMAN_HINT"] = "Travel to the NCR Town and go to the Headquarters to talk to Major Redman. You can reach the town by following the main road, and then going through the small valley."
