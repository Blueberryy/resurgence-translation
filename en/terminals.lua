			{"Local Power Failure", [[
				I'm writing this because the direct line to corporate finally stopped picking up.
				
				WE. CANNOT. WORK. WITHOUT. POWER.
				
				I don't know who the waterbrain engineer that OK'd this plant design was, but we can't so much as run a single press for more than five minutes without knocking out power to the entire area, LET ALONE both presses and the Auto-loader.
				
				In the time it took for the phone lines to come back up, we already had a small crowd of townies at the front gate, yelling at our staff. Followed up by a VERY irate call from the Colonel presiding over the military base across the river. Do you know how many boots are stationed at his base at any given time? Because I do now, as well as EXACTLY where he promised he'd plant'em if this happens again.
				
				Unless you plan on paying us to staff the country's largest paperweight, you'll get someone out here to see about hooking us up with an on-site generator. A GOOD ONE. Me and my men aren't gonna end up on some Army firing line over a paycheck.
			]]},
			{"Noise complaints", [[
				Now that the machines are finally running, we've got another problem. The noise. I don't know if its the shape of the canyon we're in, but God Damn if these things aren't loud.
				
				So loud, in fact, there isn't a single place in town where you can't hear the things. The foreman of the local mine took time out of MY busy schedule to tell me about how they can feel the 'vibrations' from all the way underground, 'rattling' their support frames and threatening to 'collapse' the entire outfit.
				
				I'd almost feel sorry for the people in this town if it weren't for the fact they keep starting fights with my men off the clock. After a week of filling our mailbox with written complaints, thinly-veiled threats, and open threats; some have taken up throwing bottles and rocks while our backs are turned.
				
				I don't care how big the contract corporate snagged is, we can't run these things 24/7. These people have to sleep, YOUR EMPLOYEES INCLUDED! And we can't get so much as a wink in without risking some townie putting a pillow over our face.
			]]},
			{"Vandalism/Sabotage", [[
				This is getting ridiculous.
				
				Not content with harassing my employees from a distance, someone broke into the factory grounds last night. Tires, brake lines, and seats of every delivery truck. Slashed. Liquid tanks at the rear of the building, nozzles broke and drained completely. Most exterior door locks plugged with chewing gum.
				
				Worst of all, they hit the outside Power Distributors. HARD. I don't think they could have done more damage if they used an explosive. Taking into account those rock breakers to the west, or the Jarheads to the east, it could have been just that. Without the supplies on hand to repair them, machine productivity has been cut in half.
				
				The sheriffs took over an hour to get here and barely looked over the place before saying there was nothing they could do. One of the bastards actually let off a line to the effect of 'call us if it happens again, so long as the power isn't out'. Enough is enough. I don't care how many times you've denied my request for additional security measures, insurance rates be damned. It's not like I'm asking for a fleet of Protectrons here! Corporate approval or no, I'm diverting a couple of heads to provide on-site security after dark, myself included. I know we've got a ladder around here for cleaning out the gutters, and the roof would make the perfect vantage point.
				
				We'll see how clever those townies feel when the next one leaves here in a black bag.

                There's this doctor lady who comes by here for a drink once every couple weeks. Covered head to toe in some advanced radsuit, never seen one like that before.
                
				She gives me a weird, vaguely threatening feeling. The first thing she asked me was if I sold medical supplies. I said no, she said 'Good'.
				Her name's Vic, allegedly. Doesn't stay in one place for too long, and sells meds at a scalper's price. Travels alone, too. Either lucky, or dangerous. She was asking me about some antenna across the valley the other day. I wasn't too informative.
                There was a doctor in the mining town across the basin from here. He isn't there anymore. Pretty sure she had something to do about that.
                
				Keep an eye on her.

			{"STAY AWAY FROM SALEM!", [[
                Note to self: when traveling to and from Portland, take the 99W instead of I-5.
                
				Almost got locked away (not metaphorically, actually) on my way to Headquarters this time. Those bastards 'forgot' to tell me the Salem Police Department climbed out of their graves last week.
				They tell me some group of wasters managed to turn on the reactors powering most of the city, trying to start a town for themselves. Sounds like it would've been nice, I need more places to sell. Unfortunately it didn't.
                Turns out that in their efforts to get the lights back on, the idiots also woke up the entire city's automated police force, and then were all immediately arrested, tried in robot court, and sentenced accordingly.
                
				I almost ended up the same a few days ago. When I was approaching Salem on my usual route a duo of bots approached me and asked for identification. I obviously didn't have any, so they tried arresting me.
                Managed to shoot those two down, but had to make a run for it as about fifteen others immediately appeared out of nowhere and open fire. The entire area is lit up like a christmas party and crawling with the cops now.
                
				No way am I going to prison. I've read how bad it was in there before the war- one could only imagine the conditions now.

			{"New Products", [[
                I've been requested to come up with a new line of suits.
                
				Ballistic fiber weaving. Expensive, but very possible. Flame retardant coating that lasts. Even more expensive, still possible. The only issue is these guys want it to WEIGH THE SAME AS A REGULAR SUIT. No matter how many prototypes I come up with, they're never happy about it.
                By this point, I don't care anymore. I've somehow gotten it down to twenty pounds, and that's a miracle in itself. They're going to have to deal with it.
                
				I better be paid well for this.
			]]},
			{"A Couple Of Weirdos", [[
				These two ghouls showed up today.
				
				Very unusual. The first thing I noticed about them was their hair- Ghouls don't have hair most of the time. These two had full, thick and shiny locks. They also smelled like shit. The second they walked in the door the entire room filled up with this awful chemical smell.
				
				It was the hair.

				They're wigmakers, it turns out. Because ghouls- and some humans- can't grow hair, they fulfil that need and make a decent living off it.
				Cool. After they were done telling me their life story I asked them to get the hell out of my bar on account of that awful smell. They refused and I had to force them out.
				
				I hope that's the last I see of those freaks.
			]]},
			{"They're back.", [[
				Those freaks from earlier this week came back.
				
				This time they begged me to let them stay, and on top of that- they want to set up shop here. I almost started shooting before the fella told me something that actually changed my mind.
				
				They sell a luxury item, to luxurious people. By setting up shop in my bar, they'd give me a lot of traffic, and traffic that's willing to shell out a pretty penny too.
				The idea sounded right at the time, so I didn't shoot them. I told them they could stay provided they got some better clothes, tried to help the smell, and promised to pay me a share of their profits.
				
				They came back the next day with some shitty, dirty suits and some slightly better smelling product. Still smells like vomit, but whatever. We'll have to see how much money they make me.

			{"New home", [[
				Hello to who ever might be readin these entries, not really used to keepin a log of things but I figured if we're gonna be stickin around here I may as well.
				I can't seem to figure out why no one lives out here, the place is a green paradice in this hell. Space, not many rads, food, wood for building. Its perfect.
				
				I was out here about 2 weeks ago explorin the old monestary after the town nearby turned out a bust, ghouls everywhere. And go figure, the monestarys the same way.
				A couple of fuckin reavers chased my skinny ass out the monestary and I had to duck in a trailer someone had backed down into the gorge. Probably the same trailer your readin this in seein as I took a liking to it.
				After I got done pissin my pants I got out and took a look around, and it hit me. This was the spot, we would just have to build our own buildings but fuck it there's wood and scrap everywhere.
				The cliff the monestary is on mixed with the ledge of the old river bed and the mountains makes a perfect barrier. We would easily set up some walls for defence. 

				So here we are. I went back out the mountain range and told the crew I found a safe place for us to set up, And I hope I'm right because we're bettin it all here.
				I dragged out the remains of the old bastard that backed the trailer in here before the others got here, he'd been here for a long while and looks like he got ate, poor guy.
				For now we set up some tents and a few guys will stay with me in 'My' new trailer, and I mean mine. We're gonna be packed in like those little fish that come in cans and it ain't stayin that way.
				Anyway I set up this old terminal after Tammy said I should keep track of our progress here for 'posperity' or somethin. So from now on when ever we make any progress or somthin happen I'll put it in here.
				I figured she would want the date we started in here so I asked around, the ol bag of shit Mikey said its 'Fall of 2235', don't know how the hell he knows this shit but there you go.

			Back from the mine, and man, a story to tell. Place is fucking infested with ants, and the church outside of it is filled with ferals, snuck by that place, not dealing with that today. Got to a huge open area, and Betty's got a computer whiz with her, so they got to lookin' at the computer.

			Turns out the place runs on some kind of fuel, need to find something to start it up, some dead guy down there with a bunch of bite marks had some weird green stuff on him, we shoved it in and it started up, and oh god did we fuck up.

			Chilled around for a minute, then we could hear the chittering, they started coming out of every tunnel, attacking the generators, so we went up the elevator, guy in a fucking suit locked a door on us, then we shot at the ants from above, let the power run out, and waited for them to leave.

			Took us a bit to get back,
