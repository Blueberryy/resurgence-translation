	In order to prevent further interuptions and down time, all heavy machinery is powered in-house by a General Automics Fusion Generator, eliminating the dependence on the local power grid.

	To ensure production meets RobCo standards please be sure to keep the generator stocked with nuclear material, power distributors properly maintained, and keep a steady supply of brass shipments incoming to the factory. Thank you and have a RobCo safe day!

	[Corperate Incident Report Log: Local Power Failure]

	I'm writing this because the direct line to corperate finally stopped picking up.

	WE. CANNOT. WORK. WITHOUT. POWER.

	I don't know who the waterbrain engineer was that OK'd this plant design was, but we can't so much as run a single press for more than five minutes without knocking out power to the entire area, LET ALONE both presses and the Auto-loader.

	In the time it took for the phone lines to come back up, we already had a small crowd of townies crowding up the front gate, yelling at our staff. Followed up by a VERY irrate call from the Colonel presiding over the military base across the river. Do you know how many boots are stationed at his base at any given time? Because I do now, as well as EXACTILY where he promised he'd plant'em if this happens again.

	Unless you plan on paying us to staff the country's largest paper weight, you'll get someone out here to see about hooking us up with an on-site generator. A GOOD ONE. Me and my men aren't gonna end up on some Army firing line over a paycheck.

	[Corperate Incident Report Log: Noise complaints]

	Now that the machines are finally running, we've got another problem. The noise. I don't know if its the shape of the canyon we're in, but God Damn if these things aren't loud.

	So loud, in fact, there isn't a single place in town where you can't hear the things. The foreman of the local mine took time out of MY busy schedule to tell me about how they can feel the 'vibrations' from all the way underground, 'rattling' their support frames and threatening to 'collapse' the entire outfit.

	I'd almost feel sorry for the people in this town if it weren't for the fact they keep starting fights with my men off the clock. After a week of filling our mailbox with written complaints, thinly-veiled threats, and open threats; some have taken up throwing bottles and rocks while our backs are turned.

	I don't care how big the contract corperate snagged is, we can't run these things 24/7. These people have to sleep, YOUR EMPLOYEES INCLUDED! And we can't get so much as a wink in without risking some townie putting a pillow over our face.

	[Corperate Incident Report Log: Vandalism/Sabotage]

	This is getting ridiculous.

	Not content with harassing my employees from a distance, someone broke into the factory grounds last night. Tires, brake lines, and seats of every delivery truck. Slashed. Liquid tanks at the rear of the building, nozzles broke and drained completely. Most exterior door locks, plugged with chewing gum.

	Worst of all, they hit the outside Power Distributors. HARD. I don't think they could have done more damage if they used an explosive. Taking into account those rock breakers to the west, or the Jarheads to the east, it could have been just that. Without the supplies on hand to repair them, machine productivity has been cut in half.

	The sheriffs took over an hour to get here, and barely looked over the place before saying there was nothing they could do. One of the bastards actually let off a line to the effect of 'call us if it happens again, so long as the power isn't out'. Enough is enough. I don't care how many times you've denied my request for additional security measures, insurance rates be damned. It's not like I'm asking for a fleet of Protectrons here! Corperate approval or no, I'm diverting a couple heads to provide on-site security after dark, myself included. I know we've got a ladder around here for cleaning out the gutters, and the roof would make the perfect vantage point.

	We'll see how clever those townies feel when the next one leaves here in a black bag.
